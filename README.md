[![Release Node.js Package](https://github.com/Hydra-Flex-Inc/alfred-alerts-reference/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hydra-Flex-Inc/alfred-alerts-reference/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml)

Providing a complete set of error codes for the equipment that the Alfred by Hydra-Flex system tracks, and also an accessor function since some types of alerts have nuances that make them a little trickier to identify.

This builds as an ES module to a private Github package at [Hydra-Flex-Inc/alfred-alerts-reference](https://github.com/Hydra-Flex-Inc/alfred-alerts-reference/pkgs/npm/alfred-alerts-reference).

You can view the descriptions and try the accessor function [here on Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/7a7dd3aa9812e513).

## Development

This project has been updated to use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automatic versioning, and will automatically publish to Github upon every push to master.

This means that we need to use the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
