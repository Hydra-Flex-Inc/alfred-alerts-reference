# Alfred Alerts Reference

[![Node.js Package](https://github.com/Hydra-Flex-Inc/alfred-alerts-reference/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hydra-Flex-Inc/alfred-alerts-reference/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yml)

Providing a complete set of error codes for the equipment that the Alfred by Hydra-Flex system tracks, and also an accessor function since some types of alerts have nuances that make them a little trickier to identify.

This builds as an ES module to a public npm package at [@kpm-at-hfi/alfred-alerts-reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kpm-at-hfi/alfred-alerts-reference).

You can view the descriptions and try the accessor function [here on Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/7a7dd3aa9812e513).
